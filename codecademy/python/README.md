## RadianToDegreeConverter

Write a function in Python that accepts one numeric parameter. This parameter will be the measure of an angle in
radians. The function should convert the radians into degrees and then return that value.

While you might find a Python library to do this for you, you should write the function yourself. One hint you get is
that you’ll need to use Pi in order to solve this problem. You can import the value for Pi from Python’s math module.

## ListSorter

Create a function in Python that accepts two parameters. The first will be a list of numbers. The second parameter will
be a string that can be one of the following values: asc, desc, and none.

If the second parameter is “asc,” then the function should return a list with the numbers in ascending order. If it’s
“desc,” then the list should be in descending order, and if it’s “none,” it should return the original list unaltered.

## RadiansToDegreesConverter

Radian: The radian is the standard unit of angular measure, used in many areas of mathematics. The length of an arc of a
unit circle is numerically equal to the measurement in radians of the angle that it subtends. One radian is just under
57.3 degrees.

Degree: A degree (in full, a degree of arc, arc degree, or arcdegree), usually denoted by ° (the degree symbol), is a
measurement of a plane angle, defined so that a full rotation is 360 degrees.
The relation 2pi*rad = 360° can be derived using the formula for arc length.

An arc of a circle with the same length as the radius of that circle subtends an angle of 1 radian. The circumference
subtends an angle of 2pi radians.

Therefore the formula is: `degree = radian * (180/pi)` where, pi = 22/7

## Scrabble

In this project, process some data from a group of friends playing scrabble. Use dictionaries to organize players,
words, and points.

There are many ways you can extend this project on your own if you finish and want to get more practice!

## Abruptly Goblins
In this off-platform project you will be the proprietor of a comic and games store, the Sorcery Society, and you decide
to host a game night to play the hot new tabletop RPG Abruptly Goblins! You’ll be writing your own Python functions and
using dictionaries to provide a new service to gaming attendees of your shop.

Your beloved clientele want to organize a game night at your comics store! Create a system for organizing and tracking
gamer’s availability. Programmatically figure out the best day to host a game night and send out emails to your
attendees to let them know when to come. Follow the steps below to get started with your project!
